Training app to learn Kotlin for the Android Development Team at Moonshot.

Created a small app using api.nookipedia.com to create a list of Animal Crossing fossils with details about each fossil. ðŸ¦•

Feel free to download it and run it on Android Studio to have a small preview of what it's like :)
